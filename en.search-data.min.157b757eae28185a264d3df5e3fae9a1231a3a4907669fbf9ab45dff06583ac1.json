The first few videos were OK, but later the quality of the content decreased and the videos became boring. Lectors spent a lot of time describing the very basic things (like indents in YAML). Sometimes they had technical issues with the cluster (for instance, the HPA didn’t work). Sometimes the just rendered themselves helpless in the face of technology (like being unable to git reset --hard and doing a full clone instead).\nBut what sucked the most were the sponsored lectures.

The main objective of PPK is to provide the participant with additional money, which can be used after the age of 60, and in exceptional situations earlier.\nParticipation in PPK is voluntary for employees. Funds accumulated in a PPK participant’s account are private and inheritable. They can also be withdrawn at any time. Automatic enrolment applies to individuals between 18 and 55 years of age.\nContributions to the PPK account come from three sources: the employer, the employee and the state.\nPPK savings are invested in defined date funds that vary the level of risk taking into account the age of the PPK participant. The Financial Supervision Authority (Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego) exercises control over employee capital plans with respect to the activities of institutions that operate the programme.\nThe basic condition for a foreigner to start saving in PPK is that the company employing the foreigner runs the programme. Other minor conditions, related to the employee’s age and his employment periods, exist.\nJoining the PPK may make it easier for a foreigner to obtain a residence card in Poland. This is due to the fact that the Office for Foreigners has access to additional information about employed foreigners saving in PPK, which can be another argument for granting the applicant the right of residence.\nRules If the employee’s information given to the employer changes, the employee should immediately update it, i.e. inform the employer of the changes. The employee should ensure, in particular, that the employer has his/her current contact details, i.e. e-mail address and telephone number (these details provided to the financial institution which will keep his/her PPK account will enable efficient contact, if needed).\nIf the data changes, the PPK participant is obliged to immediately, no later than within 30 days from the date when the change of identification data occurs, inform the financial institution running his/her PPK account about the change.\nThe PPK participant should also remember to inform his/her employer about his/her PPK accounts if the participant changes his/her place of work.\nPPK contributions Basic contribution (compulsory) Additional contribution (voluntary) Maximum contribution Employer\n1.5% of remuneration\nUp to 2.5% of remuneration\n4% of remuneration\nEmployee\n2% of remuneration*\nUp to 2% of remuneration\n4% of remuneration\n*The basic contribution may be less than 2% of remuneration, but not less than 0.5%, provided that the remuneration of the PPK participant earned from various sources in a given month does not exceed 1.2 times the minimum remuneration.\nDeclaration on reduction of basic contribution and declaration on funding of additional contributions exist and could be submitted by a PPK participant to change the amount of his contributions in the allowed boundaries.\nContributions financed by the employer — both basic and additional — constitute the PPK participant’s income from employment.\nWithdrawing PPK savings PPK savings are participant’s private property, and could be withdrawn at any time in a single payment or in installments. However, which option a given participant decides on will determine whether or not he/she will have to pay capital gains tax on the money withdrawn.\nReturn of funds from the PPK before the age of 60 A PPK participant may at any time withdraw the savings accumulated on the account in the form of cash.\nIn this case, the financial institution deducts 30% of the funds from the contributions financed by the employing entity. The deducted funds are recorded in the participant’s pension account within ZUS as his/her pension contribution.\nFunds from the welcome contribution and annual surcharges from the state are returned in full to the Labor Fund.\nThus, a PPK participant will receive:\n70% of the funds derived from contributions funded by the employing entity, less any capital gains tax due\n100% of the funds derived from contributions funded by the participant, less any capital gains tax due\nWithdrawal after age 60 If a PPK participant over 60 decides to withdraw all of the savings at once, he or she will have to pay 19% capital gains tax on 75% of the funds.\nIf he or she chooses to withdraw 25% of the accumulated funds at one time and the rest in at least 120 monthly installments (10 years) — he or she will not pay this tax. The same will happen if he or she decides to withdraw the entire accumulated savings in at least 120 monthly installments.\nEarly withdrawal of funds from PPK to cover own contribution A PPK participant may use the funds accumulated in the PPK account to cover their own contribution when taking out a loan for housing purposes. Such entitlement is available to a PPK participant who is under age 45. Additinal conditions apply.\nEarly withdrawal of PPK funds in case of illness A PPK participant may withdraw funds from the PPK account in the event of a critical illness of the PPK participant him/herself, his/her spouse or child.\nA PPK participant may apply to a financial institution for a withdrawal of up to 25% of the funds accumulated in his/her PPK account without the obligation of repayment. The request to withdraw 25% of the funds in the event of a critical illness of the participant, the participant’s spouse or child may be made by the participant more than once. Funds withdrawn will not be reduced by tax.\nTransfer payment to other PPK accounts A PPK participant may at any time make a transfer withdrawal of savings accumulated in PPK to other PPK accounts. There are no costs or taxes for the participant to make such a transfer.\nA transfer payment abroad is not currently possible.\nWithdrawal of funds from the PPK in case of death of a PPK participant In the event of the death of a PPK participant, PPK funds may be withdrawn at the request of the spouse of the deceased participant or an authorized person.\nPersons entitled to the funds of a deceased PPK participant, to whom the PPK funds will be transferred after the death of the PPK participant, will not pay income tax\nFunds from the PPK acquired through inheritance are not subject to inheritance or gift tax, nor will they be reduced by capital gains tax or any other public liability. They are paid to the heirs in full.\nLinks ✓ PPK in practice. Foreigners in Employee Capital Plans.\n❏ https://www.mojeppk.pl\n❏ https://www.nntfi.pl\n❏ The basic legal act regulating the PPK is the Act of 4 October 2018 on Employee Capital Plans (i.e., Journal of Laws of 2020, item 1342).

The routes pass through areas of natural and tourist value, including: The Niepołomice Forest, the Pieniny and Spisz Mountains, the foothills and the Tatra Mountains and, by definition, the main urban centres of the region. The ideal to which the VeloMałopolska project aspires is to obtain the EuroVelo certificate, which confirms the highest standard of bicycle paths. What does it mean in practice? It primarily means guaranteed continuity and separation of the route from road traffic. The reinforced surface (usually asphalt) is accessible in all weather conditions. Its width allows smooth movement of bicycles, including multi-track bicycles (with two-wheel trailers, handcycles), and is complemented by an appropriate elevation gain (the total amount of ascent or elevation gain in the daily section does not exceed 1000 m). Clear and bright signs guarantee that the trail can be easily found. The connection between the main cycle network and the railway provides additional comfort for cyclists, both in terms of reaching the routes and the possibility of choosing an alternative means of transport in the event of unforeseen difficulties along the route. In summary, VeloMałopolska routes are accessible and passable for all cyclists, regardless of age or their advancement level.\n— Małopolska na rowery VeloMałopolska Google Map\nRowerowa Małopolska.

Properties are qualities or characteristics of code rather than rules (principles) to follow.\nThe greatest programming trait is empathy; empathy for your users; empathy for support folks; empathy for future developers; any of whom may be future you.
