      <description>Recipes AeroPrecipe
AeroPress recipes.
Theory The AeroPress Series by James Hoffmann. [🇬🇧]
AeroPress was invented in 2005 by Alan Adler, inventor and retired Stanford University engineering instructor.
Brew for about 2 minutes (depends on the grinding).
Stir (or swirl).
Doubling the amount of coffee for dilution and making two cups doesn’t work.
Inverted method has no benefits.
Don’t press to hard.
Preheating doesn’t make any sense.
Brew at 80 °C or 100 °C.</description>
